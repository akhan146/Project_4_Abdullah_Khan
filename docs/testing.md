# Testing Strategy

The system uses three levels of testing:

## Unit Tests
Validate individual components such as password properties.

## Integration Tests
Verify that multiple components work together correctly.

## System Tests
Ensure the complete application workflow functions as expected.

## Coverage Rationale

Tests focus on:
- Core logic correctness
- Password generation validity
- Analysis accuracy
- Persistence reliability

All tests pass successfully.
